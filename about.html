				  Blood is a specialized body fluid. It has four main components:<br />
				  plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.<br />The
				  blood that runs through the veins, arteries, and capillaries is known
				  as whole blood,<br />
				  a mixture of about 55 percent plasma and 45 percent blood cells. About
				  7 to 8 percent of<br />
				  your total body weight is blood. An average-sized man has about 12
				  pints of blood in his<br />
				  body, and an average-sized woman has about nine pints.
